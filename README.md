This was a quick coding challenge for Factorio. I'm sure there's ways to make it better, just need time to actually work on it. 

To use:
Run the script and have Factorio running in windowed mode. 
Open the map with artillery remote in hand and biter nests visible in map view
Click the 'Fire' Button and pray it works
